This repository provides the implementation of the **Hybrid SFANC‚ÄëFxNLMS algorithm** for Active Noise Control (ANC) as proposed in the paper:

> ‚ÄúA Hybrid SFANC‚ÄëFxNLMS Algorithm for Active Noise Control Based on Deep Learning‚Äù (IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2022)  
> Authors: Zhengding Luo, Dongyuan Shi, Woon‚ÄëSeng Gan
>
> "Optimised Deep Learning ANC with FxEHCAF Algorithm "
> 
> Authors: Krishna Kumar, Devansh Wadhvana, Hard Kapadia

The hybrid approach combines a **lightweight 1D CNN** for selecting a pre-trained control filter per frame and the **FxNLMS** algorithm to dynamically update its coefficients at the sampling rate.

## üìù What It Does / Overview

- Trains a **1D convolutional neural network (CNN)** to **choose** the best pre-trained control filter given a noise frame.  
- After selecting, uses the **FxNLMS algorithm** to **adaptively update** the coefficients of that filter at the sample level.  
- The hybrid method is designed to **speed up convergence**, **improve noise attenuation**, and **adapt better** to varying acoustic conditions.  
- You can run real-world tests using `SFANC‚ÄëFxNLMS for ANC.ipynb`, with the provided real noise recordings.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer (tested with 3.9.7)  
- PyTorch (1.10.1)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Standard Python libs: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, etc.

You can install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If you don‚Äôt already have `requirements.txt`, generate one including your needed libs.)*

### Running the Project

1. **Pre-trained model usage**  
   Use the CNN model already saved in `Trained models/model.pth` to run the hybrid algorithm without retraining.  

2. **Train the CNN filter selector**  
   The repo description states:  
   > They generated 80,000 broadband noise tracks (1‚ÄØs each) with random bands, amplitudes, backgrounds for train/validation/test.  
   Use your training script (if present) or adapt `Disturbance_generation.py` + `Network.py` to train.

3. **Run hybrid SFANC + FxNLMS**  
   Use `Combine_SFANC_with_FxNLMS.py` or the Jupyter notebook `SFANC‚ÄëFxNLMS for ANC.ipynb` on real noise examples in `Real Noise Examples/`.  

4. **Loading real noise**  
   Use `loading_real_wave_noise.py` to load and preprocess real recordings.

5. **Testing path / setup**  
   `Reading_path_test.py` likely helps evaluate primary and secondary path responses or test the system behavior under path variations.

## üìä Expected Results & Performance

- The hybrid algorithm aims to **overcome slow convergence** typical of standard adaptive methods, while achieving **better noise reduction** than the base SFANC method.  
- Real noise tests in the notebook should illustrate attenuation levels and convergence plots.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Tips

- Ensure **sampling rate consistency** across your noise signals, network input, and FxNLMS algorithm.  
- The CNN acts at the **frame level**, while FxNLMS works at **sample level**.  
- You may need to **modify filter lengths**, **step sizes**, or **CNN architecture** when moving to new acoustic environments.  
- Use the provided real noise examples to validate the approach under real-world conditions.
